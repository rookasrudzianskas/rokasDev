    description: `Hi ðŸ‘‹ Let me introduce myself

I started my career as a Fullstack Developer when I was 16 y.o.

In search of more freedom, I transitioned to freelancing, which quickly grew into a global software development agency ðŸ”¥

Because that was not challenging enough, I started my startup which is used by over 20k users. This experience gave another meaning to being a (notJust) developer ðŸš€

I am also a proud ex-Amazon SDE and Certified AWS Architect, Developer and SysOps. You are in good hands ðŸ‘Œ`,
